#What function did you use and why? 
#I used left join and put the us_states_df first in order to preserve all 51 
#observations even though 2 are missing from us_states

#Which variable is the key in both datasets? 
#'NAME' in us_states and 'state' in us_states_df

#What is the class of the new object?
class(us_states_stats) #tibble and dataframe. no longer an sf object. 

#exercise 8

#Exercise 12
#Using us_states and us_states_df create a new object called us_states_sel.
